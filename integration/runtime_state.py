"""Phase 20 — the pipeline's live state, published for the dashboard.

app.py (the AI pipeline) and integration/api.py (the dashboard backend) are
separate processes, and a webcam can be held by only one of them. Before this
module the dashboard had to choose: open the camera itself for a preview (no
threat scoring, no incidents recorded) or leave it to the pipeline and show
nothing live. An operator needs both at once.

So the pipeline — the only process that runs the full model — publishes what
it already computes:

  runtime/live/<camera>.jpg        the latest annotated frame (boxes, zones,
                                   threat overlay), rewritten at up to
                                   LIVE_PUBLISH_FPS
  runtime/pipeline_health.json     per-camera health, fps, activity-gate and
                                   low-light state, zone counts, model paths

and the API serves those instead of competing for the device. Every write is
atomic (write a temp file, then os.replace), so a reader never sees a torn
JPEG or half a JSON document.
