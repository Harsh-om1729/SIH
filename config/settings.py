# --- ONNX Runtime thread limits --------------------------------------------
# MUST be set before onnxruntime is imported, which is why it lives here: both
# app.py and scripts/bench_pipeline.py import config.settings before any module
# that pulls in ORT (face/, reid/, tracking/).
#
# The pipeline runs three independent ORT sessions per frame — YOLO, OSNet
# Re-ID, InsightFace. Left to itself each one sizes its intra-op pool to the
# whole machine (10 cores here), so three sessions oversubscribe the CPU and
# spend their time contending rather than computing. Measured over 3 passes of
# scripts/bench_pipeline.py on this machine, running the three interleaved:
#
#   threads   ms/frame   fps    CPU (100% = 1 core)
#   default      41.6    24.0        696%
#   2            25.5    39.3        362%      <- chosen
#   1            31.7    31.6        101%
#
# 2 is the latency optimum. Set ORT_NUM_THREADS=1 instead on a machine that has
# to share its CPU with other work: 24% slower than 2, but a seventh of the CPU
# and still faster than the unbounded default. 0 restores ORT's own choice.
