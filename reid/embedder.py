    """Person Re-ID appearance embedding: OSNet x0.25 trained on MSMT17.

    Replaces the ImageNet-pretrained ResNet-18 this used to run. ResNet-18 was
    trained to answer "is this a bus or a dog", so its features describe generic
    texture and shape and barely encode *which person* this is — measured on
    real pedestrian crops, unrelated people scored up to 0.795 cosine, above the
    0.70 threshold that was configured, so strangers were merged onto one
    person_id. OSNet is trained for person Re-ID specifically; on the same
    crops unrelated people top out at 0.501 while the same person under box
    jitter stays above 0.872 — a separation gap of 0.371 vs ResNet-18's 0.139.

    Runs through onnxruntime (already used for the YOLO detector), so no extra
    runtime dependency. The weights ship in `models/` and are never fetched at
    runtime, which keeps Phase 14's air-gapped operation intact.

    Provenance: exported from the OSNet author's released MSMT17 weights
    (huggingface.co/kaiyangzhou/osnet); the ONNX is byte-identical across the
    kornia/osnet and anriha/osnet_x0_25_msmt17 mirrors. Only change made was
    marking the batch dimension dynamic (the published file was fixed at 16),
    verified bit-exact against the original at batch 16 and batch 1.
